# AI rules

This directory contains User Rules for [Cursor AI](https://cursor.com/en) that implement the clean code principles from the [Washing your code](https://sapegin.me/book/) book.

## What are User Rules?

[User Rules](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules#user-rules) in Cursor are global rules that apply to **all your projects**. Unlike project-specific [Project Rules](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules#project-rules), User Rules ensure consistent coding standards across every project you work on.

## Setting up User Rules

1. Open Cursor
2. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Cursor settings**
3. Select **Rules & Memories**
4. Click **Add User Rule**
5. Copy the entire content from [`Rules.md`](./Rules.md) in this directory
6. Paste it into the User Rules editor
7. Save the rules (Cmd/Ctrl + S)

## Benefits of User Rules

- Apply clean code principles to **every** project
- No need to copy `.cursorrules` files to new projects
