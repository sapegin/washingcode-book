## Check types in your code

Most of the examples in this book are written in JavaScript which isn’t how I write code in the past five or so years. These days I mostly write in TypeScript — JavaScript with types. And before that I was using Flow for several years, which is now forgotten.

I was debating (and still do) whether to use JavaScript or TypeScript for the examples in the book. JavaScript is simpler, but TypeScript is more realistic. However, many “bad” examples are in JavaScript originally, and I’d have to either add types to them before doing all the refactoring or add types as part of the refactoring process. The latter would be more realistic but I feel it would distract from the topic of a particular chapter.
