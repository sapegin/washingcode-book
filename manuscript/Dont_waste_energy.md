## Don’t waste energy (= save energy for important things)

TODO: Merge with “The rest doesn’t matter”

- tabs vs spaces
- opinionated formatting (https://blog.sapegin.me/all/prettier/)
- implicit returns
- arrow functions

In all these examples I prefer the second variation. But I don’t waste time asking folks to change their code in code reviews, when they use the first variation or some other way of writing the same code.

In most cases there’s zero code readability improvement. The code is just different, none of the variations are better than the other. And even the consistency argument isn’t good enough, unless you can automate code replacement completely transparent for the developer. Otherwise the cost of maintaining the convention is too high.
