## Conclusion

All topics, covered in this book, aren’t hard rules but ideas for possible improvements. When I say _avoid conditions, mutation, reassignments or something else_, I don’t mean _never use them_, more like _are you sure there’s no better solution?_

There are valid use cases for all programming techniques, maybe even `goto`, who knows. The only certain thing is that the answer to any programming related question is _it depends_. No matter how many upvotes on Stack Overflow has a solution, it may be not the best choice for your case.

So the goal of this book isn’t to teach you how to write good code, but to teach you to notice certain patterns, or code smells, that can _often_ (not _always_) be improved.

Treating such patterns or code smells as hard rules is the road to hell.
